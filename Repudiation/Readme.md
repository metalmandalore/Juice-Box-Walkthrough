# Repudiation
I don't know who deleted the database, it wasn't me - Thoughts of a malicious insider </br>
Repudiation occurs when someone denies that they did something, and there's no way to tell if they actually did it or not. Non-repudiation is when each user leaves a log trail or signs an email with a digital certificate so there is no doubts that they are the user performing an action or sending an email. Non-repudiation security controls can mitigate spoofing attacks implemented correctly.
